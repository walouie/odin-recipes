So far in my journey with the Odin Project, I've learned bits and pieces of HTMl and using Git. Specifically, memorizing the HTMl boiler plate
The boiler plate follows:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <title>
        </title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>
    </body>
</html>
This is a very simple boiler plate where html lang indicates what language you'll be using for your page. The meta charset indicates what type of character encoding you might be using. Everything else is pretty basic. Paragraph = <p></p> bold =<strong></strong> italitcs<em></em> including an image = <img src ="" ref=""> including a link<a href="">blah blah</a>
